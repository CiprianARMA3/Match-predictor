# Match Predictor

The following code uses https://www.football-data.org/  's API and uses its data to calculate the % of the possibility of winning,drawing or loosing. It gives a multiple bet option which is : (1X,12,2X). Last but not least it also gives an average corner in the matches played by both teams.

Remember to make a ```.env ``` file with the API being in a variable called ```API_KEY``` .

Also change the UTC offset based on your location in the world. Currently UTC+2 aka Rome time.

Also please read the LICENSE file where all the informations about the usage of the following code are.
